# Todo App

A full-stack Todo application built with **Node.js**, **React**, **PostgreSQL**, and **Docker**. This project demonstrates how to containerize a full-stack application using Docker and Docker Compose.

---

## Features
- **Backend**: REST API built with Express.js.
- **Frontend**: Responsive UI built with React.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for storing todos.
- **Docker**: Multi-stage Docker builds for optimized images.

---

## Technologies Used
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js, PostgreSQL
- **Frontend**: React.js
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Containerization**: Docker, Docker Compose

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Docker**: [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- **Docker Compose**: [Install Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

---

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/todo-app.git
cd todo-app
2. Run the Application with Docker Compose
Use Docker Compose to build and start the application:

bash
Copy
docker-compose up --build
This command will:

Build the Docker images for the backend, frontend, and database.

Start the containers for all services.

3. Access the Application
Once the containers are running, you can access the application as follows:

Frontend: Open your browser and go to http://localhost.

Backend API: Access the API at http://localhost:5000/api/todos.

Docker Commands
Here are some useful Docker commands for managing the application:

Build and Start Containers
bash
Copy
docker-compose up --build
Stop Containers
bash
Copy
docker-compose down
View Logs for a Specific Service
bash
Copy
docker-compose logs <service-name>
Example:

bash
Copy
docker-compose logs backend
Remove All Containers, Networks, and Volumes
bash
Copy
docker-compose down --volumes --rmi all
Docker Hub Images
The Docker images for this project are available on Docker Hub:

Backend: <your-dockerhub-username>/todo-app-backend

Frontend: <your-dockerhub-username>/todo-app-frontend

Environment Variables
The backend service requires the following environment variables to connect to the PostgreSQL database. These are defined in the docker-compose.yml file:

yaml
Copy
environment:
  DB_USER: user
  DB_PASSWORD: password
  DB_NAME: todos
  DB_HOST: db
  DB_PORT: 5432
Project Workflow
Backend Workflow
The backend is built using Node.js and Express.js.

It exposes a REST API for managing todos.

The API connects to a PostgreSQL database to store and retrieve todos.

Frontend Workflow
The frontend is built using React.js.

It communicates with the backend API to fetch and display todos.

Users can add new todos via the frontend interface.

Docker Workflow
The application is containerized using Docker.

Docker Compose is used to orchestrate the backend, frontend, and database services.

Multi-stage Docker builds are used to optimize the size of the final images.

Contributing
Contributions are welcome! Please follow these steps:

Fork the repository.

Create a new branch (git checkout -b feature/YourFeatureName).

Commit your changes (git commit -m 'Add some feature').

Push to the branch (git push origin feature/YourFeatureName).

Open a pull request.
